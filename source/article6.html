                <p>The potential closure of the General Motors (GM) Oshawa Assembly Plant is projected to cause an economic shock across Ontario and Canada. According to an independent study commissioned by Unifor, a closure would result in the loss of 24,000 jobs, a $5 billion reduction in Ontario’s GDP, and a decrease of $330 million in provincial government revenues in the immediate aftermath.</p>

                <p>Over time, the study estimates that the closure will lead to a cumulative loss of $4 billion annually to Ontario’s economy, with the government seeing a decrease of nearly half a billion dollars in revenue. The economic effects would be far-reaching, impacting industries and workers across Canada, with job losses projected to reach 14,000 in Ontario alone by 2025, and another 10,000 elsewhere in Canada.</p>

                <p>For stakeholders and investors, this study is crucial as it highlights the potential long-term economic consequences of major decisions within the automotive industry, such as GM’s potential closure of the Oshawa plant. The ripple effect from this decision would significantly impact local economies, industries, and government revenue, emphasizing the importance of investing in sustainable, locally beneficial manufacturing practices to prevent such outcomes.</p>
