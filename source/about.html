                    <p>We are a group of Durham College students dedicated to exploring the impact of automation and robotics on the Canadian automotive industry. As the sector transitions to electric vehicle (EV) production, we aim to inform stakeholders and investors about how advanced technologies can improve manufacturing efficiency, enhance competitiveness, and support the industry's growth. Through our research, we are highlighting solutions to the challenges faced by automotive manufacturers, particularly the balance between internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV production lines. By advocating for the adoption of automation, we aim to help Canadian companies thrive in a rapidly evolving market.</p>
